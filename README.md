# Quarter-Close-alm-mini-system
Built a Quarter-Close ALM mini-system (Transamerica-style): generates AXIS-like inputs from holdings + assumptions, runs base/scenario valuation, produces KPI dashboard, exceptions, rollforwards + surplus attribution, versions quarterly assumptions, creates reinvestment plan, and packages a recruiter-ready close pack ZIP.
